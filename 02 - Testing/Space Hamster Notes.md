## General Concept
A hamster that is the pet of Rocket Scientist's child, visits "the lab" with its owner's parent during the day while she attends school and learns enough to convert its cage into a spaceship
Powered by infinitely renewable energy (the hamster running on its wheel), the little critter is able to visit this space it has heard so much about. 

Using FTL (the only way to do space travel), it is able to visit a different planet each day and be back in time to play with its owner.
