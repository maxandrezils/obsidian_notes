Create a reusable, centralised API client for communicating with the Django backend using session-based authentication. This client should expose hook-based access patterns (e.g. `useApi()`) to simplify and standardise API calls across the React app. 

| Acceptance Criteria                                        | Scenario                                                                                         | Expected Result                                                                    | Screenshot | Status |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Session cookies are sent                                   | All API requests by the React Front End are sent with session cookies                            | Session cookies should be included under the request headers for all requests.     |            |        |
| CSRF tokens are attached correctly                         | All non get requests include the CSRF token                                                      | The request header includes the CSRF token                                         |            |        |
| Session-based requests work end-to-end with Django backend | All requests can access the data from the Django back-end                                        | redaction data, attachments and patient details can be seen and or interacted with |            |        |
| Common errors (e.g. unauthorised) are handled globally     | For any form of validation, i.e. emr is unavailable, session expired, a valid error is displayed |                                                                                    |            |        |
