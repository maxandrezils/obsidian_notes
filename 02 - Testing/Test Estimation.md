The best approach that I'm using to estimate the testing tasks (user stories) is to consider the following three factors: 1- Preparation (T1) This phase involves the initial groundwork, including writing comprehensive test cases, preparing the necessary test data, and configuring the testing environment if required. 2- Execution (T2) the time that I'll need to execute my test cases, report bugs, retest, and close the fixed bug. 3- Validation (T3) here, I run a quick regression test to cover the end-to-end (E2E) scenarios before closing the user stories. So, The total estimation for a specific user story is the sum of T1, T2, and T3.

$$
\sum = T_{1} + T_{2} +T_{3}
$$

### T1 Some things to consider
- Do you have a lot of scenarios with minor variations - consider a test matrix
- Do you need to setup a lot of test data in order to test the scenario?
- Do you need external support to setup test data or validate your scenarios?
