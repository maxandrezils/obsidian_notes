As a GP user, I want to be able to delete an instruction during different phases of report processing so that I can manage my instructions efficiently and remove any that are no longer needed at any stage.

**Wireframe/Design:**

Miro board: [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO8s5tdk=/](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO8s5tdk=/)

Delete button to be added at the bottom of the page. If there is no button on the bottom right, add the delete instruction button to the bottom


1. Add “Delete Instructions” as a permissions option in the user management settings.

2. If the checkbox is ticked for Delete Instructions, the user type for that surgery will see the delete button.
    
3. If a user type does not have permission to delete, the "Delete Instruction" button is not visible at any stage.
